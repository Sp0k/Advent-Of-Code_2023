# Advent of Code 2023
This is one of the two event I was looking forward to the most this year. I
almost needed an advent calendar for this advent calendar. This year's story is
a cute one. There's something wrong with the snow production and we have to take
look into it. The elves want us to go look at fifty locations to see what the
problem is (one for every challenge). Each challenge award one star and the goal is
to have all 50 stars by the 25th as well as the shortest time to solve the 
challenges.

I will update my progress in this repository every day if I am able to, I will try
to go as far as I can in the challenges, but I will leave this warning, I am in
the middle of my exam season and I do have a major surgery midway through the month
,so I might stop in the middle of the challenge and try to solve them at a later 
date and some days might be late.

## Organization of the repository
I will organize this repository in a way that would be easy to navigate. Each day
will have their own directory in which I will have a directory for the input files
called files and a directory for the code files called code. There would also be a 
README file acting as my thoughts about the challenges of the day.

If I come up with more than one solution (i.e. write a solution in different 
languages, which I would like to try), I will either create a new directory in the
code directories for each language I coded a solution in.

## My scores and time
In this section, I will keep my daily placements and my time scores for each 
challenge. I just think it will be funny to have them stored somewhere. I forgot to
do so for the first few days, but I will also try to have a timer running each time
I start a new challenge, at least keep track of time so I know how long it took me
to complete a challenge after I started it and not just after it was released like
the official website does.
